What You Can Do with This Data
You can use this data to determine brand markups, pricing strategies, and trends for luxury shoes E.g.:

What is the average price of each distinct brand listed?

Which brands have the highest prices?

Which ones have the widest distribution of prices?

Is there a typical price distribution (e.g., normal) across brands or within specific brands?

Further processing data would also let you:

Correlate specific product features with changes in price.

You can cross-reference this data with a sample of our Women's Shoe Prices to see if there are any differences between women's brands and men's brands.
